OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------
This service enables the creation of FBA model constraint objects that are based on regulatory
networks and expression data, as described in [1].  Constraints are constructed by either automatically
aggregating necessary information from the CDS (if available for a given genome), or by adding user
expression and regulatory data.  PROM provides the capability to simulate transcription factor knockout
phenotypes.  PROM model constraint objects are created in a user's workspace, and can be operated on and
used in conjunction with an FBA model with the KBase FBA Modeling Service.

NOTE: 8/23/2013
------------------------------------------
-Critical dependencies (workspace service, FBA modeling) are currently being refactored,
so the PROM service will temporarily be unstable until these interfaces have been updated.
We expect an updated Prom service that is more stable to be released at the end of 2013.



VERSION: 0.0.1 (Released 1/28/2013)
------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
-This is the first public release of the PROM service, all features are new.

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
-none.

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
-Move expression data and regulation network manipulation methods out of this
service and into the regulation service and future expression data service
-Add methods to load user regulatory networks and gene expression data that
is not available from the regulation service or the CDM.
-Add method to change the namespace of features in an expression data collection.
